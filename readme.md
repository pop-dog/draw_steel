## **How is it different from D&D/Pathfinder?**

- **Three-tiered roll results instead of two**
    - Rather than being based on a binary pass/fail system (e.g., roll a d20 and meet some DC), this engine is based around a three-tiered level-of-success system.
      - For example, in combat, you don't roll to hit. You will always do *something*, but you roll to see how effective it is.
- **Equipment is abstracted**
    - **Kits** are an abstraction of the *type* of gear your hero uses.
        - E.g. *Shining Armor: You wear **heavy armor** and wield a **shield** and **medium weapon**.*
            - Heavy armor: Could be chain mail, ring mail, or plate, in a variety of styles
            - Shield: A kite shield, round shield, or tower.
            - Medium weapon: A longsword, warhammer, battleaxe, or other such weapon that can be wielded in one hand, leaving the other free. Heavier than a light weapon, such as a dagger, which could be used to make several attacks in quick succession.
    - You don’t track food/drink or mundane equipment. If your character can scale a cliff, it is assumed they have ropes and pitons, or other applicable gear (unless circumstances prevent this)
- **It’s not about dwindling resources**
    - Your resources are gained per-encounter or per-round, not per-day.
    - Nightly rest is not related to your heroic resource — the closest equivalent is the 24-hour *Respite* where you regain all of your *Stamina* at the expense of your accrued *Victories*.

## Heroes

### Characteristics
Each player controls a **Hero**. Heroes have five *characteristics*:
- **[M]ight** represents strength and brawn. Heroes use Might to break down doors swing an axe, stand up during an earthquake, or hurl and ally across a chasm.
- **[A]gility** represents coordination and nimbleness. Heroes use Agility to backflip out of danger, shoot a crossbow, dodge an explosion, or pluck keys from a guard's belt.
- **[R]eason** represents a logical mind and education. Heroes use Reason to solve a puzzle that unlocks a door, recall lore about necromancy, decipher a coded message, or blast a foe with psionic power.
- **[I]ntuition** represents instincts and experience. Heroes use Intuition to recognize a faint sound as the approach of a distant rider, quickly read the tell of a bluffing gambler, calm a rearing horse, or track a monster across the tundra.
- **[P]resence** represents force of personality. Heroes use Presence to lie to a judge, convince a croud to join a revolution, impress a queen at a royal banquet, or cast a magic spell by singing a song.

### Ancestry
**Ancestry**. The *species* of your hero. Your ancestry determines your physical appearance and grants some innate abilities but does not determine your **characteristics**.

Choose from:
- **Devil**: Devils originated in the Seven Cities of Hell and have a super natural charisma that helps them persuade others. They are similar in 
stature to humans, and their skin tones include deep blues, purples, and  reds. They sport horns, eyes of all shades (including gold and red), and 
tails, and some have feathered or leathery wings.
- **Dragon Knight**: Dragon knights are muscled draconic humanoids who stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. The scales covering their reptilian 
heads, bodies, and tails can be almost any color. All dragon knights have wings, but on only a few are those wings big enough to let them fly.
    - They bred artificially to serve in Good King Omund's Dragon Phalanx and were once a symbol of justice in Vasloria. Ajax, the Invincible Overlord, has placed a high bounty on the head of all Dragon Knights.
 - **Memonek**: Originating on Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, memonek are a machine people made of metal, marble, glass, and other inorganic materials. Their bodies are lightweight, making them easier to move and letting them fall at slower speeds.
 **Orc**: Orcs have skin in green tones and stand slightly taller and wider than humans. A supernatural energy they call “the blood fire” flows through their veins, igniting colorful lines in an orc’s skin during life-or-death battles.
 **Polder**: The smallest of the ancestries in this book, polders stand no taller than 3-1/2 feet. They look like smaller humans, and they have the ability to blend in with the shadows.
 **Revenant**: No hero starts their life as a revenant. Rather, these undead creatures return to the world of the living because they have dire business that must be finished. A character of any ancestry can become a revenant.
 **Time Raider**: Travelers of the timescape, the time raiders (or kuran’zoi as they call themselves) have four arms and a single ocular sensor instead of a pair of eyes. Many have innate psionic abilities that make them capable warriors.

### Culture
A Hero's **culture** is how they were raised and determines things like the type of name they have, what language(s) they speak, and options for what **skills** they possess. You will develop your Hero's culture by deciding on a Language, Environment, Organization, and Upbringing.

### Career
What did your Hero do before they took up the call to adventure? Your career will give you additional Skills and Languages, as well as Renown, Wealth, Project Points, and Perks.
**Inciting Incidents.** Each career has a list of inciting incidents, each of which suggests a potential reason why you gave up your career, turned away from a possibly comfortable and reliable living, and took up the sword (or axe or wand) to become an adventuring hero.

### Class
Classes in Draw Steel serve the same general purpose as other RPGs. Some key differences are:
1. Every class has a **Heroic Resource**; these are the *points* you spend to perform abilities. As mentioned above, these usually replenish on a per-encounter or even per-round basis, as opposed to per-day.
2. Some classes have access to *Kits*; this allows you to customize the look, feel, and gameplay of your Hero. For instance, the **Censor** class is a devotee of a saint or god and may use the **Warrior Priest** kit to be like an armored Paladin or the **Robe and Stick** kit to be like a priest.

#### Class List

 - **Censor**: A censor is a trained warrior devoted to a saint or god. They hunt down the forces of evil using melee weapons and magic granted to them by their divine patron, specializing in confronting the wicked and locking down single enemies during combat.
 - **Conduit**: A conduit is the devoted priest of a saint or god. They wield divine magic that smites enemies with holy energy and supports their allies, and are renowned for their healing abilities.
 - **Elementalist**: An elementalist studies the elemental forces of the timescape and controls earth, fire, the void, and more with magic. 
Many of their abilities cover wide areas of the battlefield, and they have a versatile array of tricks that allow them to both control combat and 
manipulate the environment around them when the fight is done.
-**Fury**: Coursing with the ferocity of the Primordial Chaos in their veins, a fury is a mobile warrior who gets up close and personal with enemies to dish out lots of damage. Leaping around the battlefield felling foes and breaking down walls is where the fury lives.
-**Null**: Disciplined and calm, the null is an unarmed warrior who manifests an aura that quells the supernatural and hinders the offensive prowess of their enemies. They use psionics to make their body stronger than any steel and faster than any steed.
- **Shadow**: Stalking from the darkness, the shadow is an expert assassin and thief who fights equally well in melee and at range as they get the drop on their foes. They utilize magic to help them stay mobile on the battlefield and sneak up on their prey.
- **Tactician**: A brilliant strategist and weapons master, the tactician excels at granting allies more movement and actions on the battlefield. They also support allies outside of combat, always inspiring their friends to greatness.
- **Talent**: A talent is the master of psionics, manifesting powers that manipulate objects, minds, and time. These heroes can reach far into themselves to use abilities even when they don’t have their Heroic Resource to spare—if they’re willing to face the cost.
- **Troubadour**: A troubadour inspires their allies with storytelling and swordplay that is as much an art as it is an act of war. Their quips, songs, poems, and epic tales produce actual magic that harms foes and bolsters allies. They can even use their magic to tweak the campaign’s 
story in real time to better suit their needs.

### Perks (similar to Feats)
Perks are features that your Hero can use **outside of combat**. There are 6 types:
- **Crafting** perks improve your talent for crafting materials, and let you become an expert in the things you create. 
- **Exploration** perks let you better traverse and explore different environments.
- **Interpersonal** perks improve your interactions with other creatures.
- **Intrigue** perks make you more effective at investigating mysteries and finding the truth, even as you keep your own secrets hidden.
- **Lore** perks improve your mastery of memory, language, and knowledge across a range of topics.
- **Supernatural** perks let you use magic and psionics to influence the world around you.

### Complications
A **complication** is an *optional* customization that gives your Hero some **Benefit** at the cost of a **Drawback**. They have both mechanical aspects and story implications, and there is a table of 100 of them that you can randomly roll from or just pick one.
