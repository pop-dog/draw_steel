# Draw Steel

## What is it?
> Draw Steel is a tabletop RPG designed for games about heroic characters battling monsters in a fantasy setting.

## **How is it different from D&D/Pathfinder?**
If I were to give a 1-sentence answer to **What is D&D?**, it would be:
> D&D is a *medieval fantasy* tabletop RPG about *simulating* an adventurer.

So, the high-level differences are:

1. **Simulating *characters*, not people**. Draw Steel's mechanics are about simulating a movie or book character, rather than a whole person. For example, in D&D, you track your arrows, your torches, your rations, etc. In Draw Steel, equipment is abstracted in **Kits** -- you have a particular *type* of armor and weapons which affect how your character plays in combat, but if, for instance, your character has a bow, you don't need to track how many arrows you have -- it's assumed you brought enough with you. *Is it important how many arrows Legolas has in his quiver? In Draw Steel: no. That's not what the game is about.*
   1. Note: this is a difference in what the system is designed for, not what is *allowed*. We can still roleplay the heroes getting a room at the local inn, but there is no explicit rule stating the heroes need to sleep for 8 hours each night, and what the consequences are if they don't (although they should and it is assumed that they do). There is a system of *Edges* and *Banes* which could apply to something like this when dramatically appropriate. For example, if one of your companions was kidnapped by a band of hobgoblins and you must chase them through the night for two nights in a row, you may find yourself with a **Bane** to your tracking skill on the third day, simulating the exhaustion of your forced march.
2. **No resource attrition (except health).** In D&D, your character starts each day with a full resource pool (spell slots, ki points, etc.) which you drain throughout the adventuring day. In Draw Steel, your character regains their resources at the start of each encounter/round, so you should always have tactical choices to make in combat, and never be in a position where all you have left are cantrips. In fact, as you beat encounters you gain Victories, which increase your hero's power, but this will likely come at the cost of Stamina (essentially, HP). So, the gameplay loop is balancing how many encounters you can push before you need to take a Respite to regain Stamina.
3. **No roll to hit**. There is no roll to hit in combat; you just roll to see how *effective* you are. Higher effect means dealing more damage, imposing stronger debuffs, or pushing enemies further away, but you will always do *something* on your turn.
4. **Familiar tropes with unique twists**. Lastly, Draw Steel is obviously inspired by a lot of the same fantasy as D&D. As such, it has similar ancestries and classes, but with different interpretations. For your first character, I would recommend first reading through the ancestries and classes to get some inspiration, rather than coming up with an idea for a D&D character, then trying to *port* that into this system.
